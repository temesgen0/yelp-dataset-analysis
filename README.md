Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables ?
2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table ?
3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields ?
5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order ?
6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities ?
7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews ?
8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans ?
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them ?
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans ?

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
